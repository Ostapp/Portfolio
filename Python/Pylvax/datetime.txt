datetime

dtm = datetime.datetime.now() - time now 

dtmUTC = datetime.datetime.utcnow() - UTC time now

str(dtm) - converts to string, but on different machines it looks differently

dtm.isoformat() - to make it in universal format
isoformat is needed when there is a need to communicate between machines

local time is not good, because it has time zone and winter/summer time
 
UTC - Universal Time Coordinated, 0 tiemzone, no daylight saving time - solves that problem
